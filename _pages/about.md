## About Theorems and Things

Welcome to <span style="color:turquoise">*Theorems and Things*</span>, a space where curiosity meets calculation, and where the mysteries of science and math unfold in ways you might not expect. Here, I dive into the formulas, theorems, and principles that shape our understanding of the world—breaking them down to their essence and exploring the journey of discovery behind each one.

How did we arrive at the elegant simplicity of <span style="color:turquoise">E=mc²</span>? What was it like for mathematicians to unlock the secrets of calculus or probability? Each post is a dive into the “how” and “why” behind the rules and the thinkers who brought them to life, revealing a side of math and science that’s both awe-inspiring and deeply human.

I also will write occasionally about random <span style="color:turquoise">things</span> I'm interested in like books, tv shows, and video games. Whether you're a lifelong learner, a student, or just someone who’s fascinated by the wonder of the unknown, this blog is for you. Join me as we explore the breathtaking logic of mathematics, the strange truths of physics, and the surprising intersections of numbers and nature. After all, every theorem has a story, and every scientific law holds a little mystery.

Happy exploring!
