### Why *Dragon Ball* Means So Much

It's really funny to say, but <span style="color:turquoise">*Dragon Ball*</span> means more to me than most things in my life. You're probably thinking…this guy's an immature man child. You'd be spot on. But that's beside the point. This is different than just an average fanboy obsession. <span style="color:turquoise">*Dragon Ball*</span> introduced an entire generation to a raw example of true grit; it displayed the strength of emotional composure in the face of overwhelming odds. It took us on a journey of what it means to try hard as hell, especially when everything’s against you. But what highlighted the franchise for me was the mentality characters adopted in moments of steep climax. Their zombie-like optimism gives them an undying source of will and confidence, which lends them the strength to become better. Instead of letting their newfound power feed their ego, they achieve new heights by humbling themselves.

### The Creative Mind of Akira Toriyama

Like most successful creators, I don't think Akira Toriyama believed his work would be as impactful as it is today. He’s actually known to be a spontaneous writer, developing plots for his characters as they come to him rather than carefully filling out the silhouette of a preordained story.

This style of storytelling directly complements the main protagonist's personality. Ever since Mr. Toriyama brought Goku to life, he influenced the entire genre of shounen to adopt a different tone.

### Goku: A Different Kind of Hero

Goku is a naive dumbass at his core—a type of person that all of us can relate to on some level. This personality contrasts beautifully with his thirst for strength, a rat race usually reserved for those with malicious intent.

Despite his immaturity, his persistence knows no bounds. He gets stronger and faster, all while maintaining his innocence. To me, his simple nature exemplifies how one can grow through life's obstacles without giving up a joyous perspective. Too often, we see examples of power and dominance being attained by characters who have become dark and brooding in their journey to greatness. Goku’s consistent outlook after his cruelest conflicts is refreshing and different.

### The Nostalgia of Growing Up with *Dragon Ball*

I remember coming back from elementary school hoping to get home in time to catch the <span style="color:turquoise">*next episode of Dragon Ball Z*</span> with my younger brother. The point of this rant is to reveal that I'm not alone in this.

There is a generation of people who have been influenced the way I have. It’s gotten us through life's hardships with our juvenile sense of wonder intact. This is, in fact, a mark of good fiction. It's not real by definition and, as a consequence, gets us to aspire towards heights we can only imagine. Good fiction caters to the optimist in us.

### An Era of “Z-Fighters”

It's funny because I feel like I've grown up with this fandom, and since then, I’ve seen <span style="color:turquoise">*Dragon Ball*</span> influence us in very similar ways. Its philosophy has led us to find success in our relative fields of interest. I know this because its representation is more prevalent now than it's ever been, mainly because the show's initial audience is finally old enough to have a voice. It’s an era of "Z-fighters" I'm proud as hell to be a part of.
